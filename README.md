# Tata Data Visualization Virtual Internship
This virtual internship is designed to gain insights into leveraging data visualizations as a tool for making informed business decisions and creating amazing stories that are hidden under the mountains of data generated. 

## Introduction
An online retail store wants to review its data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyze what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.
The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on whatâ€™s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

## Task 1: Framing the Business Scenario
Anticipating the questions the business leaders will need answers to.
Reviewed the data, taking note of what information has been provided, what insights can be garnered, and what is relevant to both the CEO and CMO respectively.
Drafted the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.

## Task 2: Choosing the Right Visuals

The impact visualization plays in 
- Conveying the right message to the audience through visuals
-	Finding outliers in the data

## Task 3: Creating Effective Visuals
Data contained some returns to the store which were provided in negative quantities and there were unit prices which were input in error.
Performed the following steps to clean this data.
+	Create a check that the quantity should not be below 1 unit
+	Create a check that the Unit price should not be below $0

Used the cleaned data to create the visuals around four of the questions that the CEO and CMO have requested using Tableau.

**Question 1**  
  The CEO of the retail store is interested in viewing the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

**Question 2**  
  The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

**Question 3**  
  The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue-generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue-generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue-generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

**Question 4**  
  The CEO is looking to gain insights into the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

## Task 4: Communicating Insights and Analysis
Effectively communicated the findings and explained how they relate to each scenario.
